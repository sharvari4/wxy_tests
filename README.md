To take a test, please clone the relevant branch and send us back a repo with a completed notebook!

## Geospatial Python Test

Please analyze and visualize Active Major Construction permits in New York City in a jupyter notebook. The data can be downloaded [here](https://nycdob.github.io/DOB_Dashboards/layouts/two-and-one/Active_ConstructionTM_withGraphs).

At a minimum:

- Create a summary table with key metrics
- Visually explore key metrics, including at least one time series graph
- Perform a spatial join against another layer of your choice (e.g. Census layers, transit walksheds, etc.)
- Create a summary table making use of the joined data points
- Export your final data to excel and shapefile


Optionally, include some extra analysis or functionalities of your choice. A few ideas:
- Turn your analysis into an executable script for processing new permit data from the same source, exporting key data points and charts
- Perform a statistical test on the data (e.g. linear regression, clustering) and characterize results
- Scale/normalize key metrics and create a composite indicator of development activity
- Identify existing parcel land uses and buildings to understand how the build landscape is changing

Please do not spend more than two hours on this test. We do not want you to go overboard! The objective of this test is to get a flavor for your coding style and analytical approach. We will run the notebook in order so make sure you don't have any bugs!

None of your code will be used by WXY for project work.
